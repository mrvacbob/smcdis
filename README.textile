What it's supposed to be

=======================================

smcdis is a disassembler and explorer for SNES ROM images.
Since ROM images are unformatted, it uses abstract interpretation
to find all possible function entry points and tell apart text and
data sections.

=======================================

What it actually does

=======================================

Figures out the ROM format and original dumper hardware for (most)
images, and prints out a lot of headers, with more accurate meanings
than all other SNES emulators I tried (including bsnes). Unfortunately
these fields are all useless, so I guess it's just historically interesting?

=======================================

TODO

=======================================

# Print Japanese ROM names in the right charset
# Fill out the empty entries in company_names[]
# Remember what disasm.cpp was supposed to do (besides the entire
rest of the programâ€¦) and finish it

The abstract interpreter doesn't have to be very good (unless games
switch between 8- and 16-bit more than I think), and probably doesn't even
have to bother with known-1/known-0 dataflow. That can be saved for the
SNES decompiler.
